# Algorithms-EC330
This GitHub repository showcases my work from a comprehensive course focused on the fundamentals and applications of algorithms and data structures. The course provided a deep dive into the general concept of algorithms, emphasizing their efficiency and runtime. It covered an array of critical topics, including graph algorithms, priority queues, and search trees, offering a robust understanding of their practical applications. The coursework also explored various algorithm design approaches, catering to both numerical and non-numerical problems. This repository contains a selection of projects and code samples that demonstrate my proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and my ability to optimize data structures for efficiency and performance. Through these projects, I've gained valuable insights into the complexities of algorithm design and its impact on software development and computational problem-solving.
